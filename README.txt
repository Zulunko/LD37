This is a project completed for Ludum Dare 37. Ludum Dare is a 48 hour game development competition wherein you attempt to make a playable experience from scratch. All code and assets were written and created in the 48 hour window, though some (albeit sparse) comments have been added after-the-fact for readability.

The game is a twist on a tower defense game. You, as the player, have no weapons and can only place towers, but you can move and the enemies continuously seek toward you.

Placing towers costs resources which you need to pick up around the map and enemies get faster and more numerous as you continue to survive. Once you survive 10 waves, you win.

All non-basic assets were created by me (Eric Lang), including audio.

Offhand I don't recall exactly what place I got, but I remember people thought it was fairly fun.
